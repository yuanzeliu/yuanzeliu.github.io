Hi! This is Yuanze (pronunciation: [yuăn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-yu%C7%8En.ogg) [zé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-z%C3%A9.ogg), sounds like YOO-ahn-zuh). I am a first-year PhD student in Behavioral Science at Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, where I work with Professor [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/).  

I study cultural evolution across many kinds of cultural groups, including organizations, political groups, and national cultures. I am especially interested in the cultural impact of new institutions and technologies (e.g., [large AI models](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx)). Ultimately, my work aims to understand how we can build better forms of collective life. My research revolves around three broad questions: 

First, I ask why human psychology (e.g., person perception, prejudice) has taken its current form and how it co-evolves with social ecology (e.g., [state centralization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth), [globalization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753), [digitalization](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/ai_prioritization.pdf)) to support human adaptation. 

My second line of research investigates when cultural evolution malfunctions. Human societies are complex systems that often evolve without centralized design or foresight. Hence, mechanisms that are adaptive under one context or evaluation criterion can malfunction when contexts or evaluation standards shift. My research examines the evolutionary origins and dynamics of such malfunctions, such as [loneliness epidemic](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), [entrenched prejudice](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth) and [inequality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [political polarization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7cqfs_v3), and [resistance to cross-cultural communication](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753). 

Third, to address these puzzles, I study how human communities can intentionally steer their own cultural evolution—for example, by deciding [which practices to adopt](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7bqxp_v1), [what ideas to spread](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [how information circulates](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), and [how disagreements are managed](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gfdwx_v1).
