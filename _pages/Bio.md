I was born in mid-fall after a major flood in southern China. My parents chose my name as a small pun. Publicly, most people read it in a Confucian key—beneficence that reaches far. Privately (not so secret anymore), it simply means staying away from marshes and floods. They wanted me safe, and I was.

I spent my first 14 years in the same town without leaving once. Both of my parents are locals, and our family records trace back about a thousand years—my advisor and friend Josh even visited our family temple and can vouch for it.

By all expectations I might have stayed, grown old, and died there. I still remember my mom telling me in kindergarten that her biggest hope was for me to finish high school so she could throw a big party. But I have an adventurous streak. At 14 I left home for school, lived four years in Changsha, seven in Beijing, and I have been in Chicago for more than two years—already looking toward the next stop.

That same adventurousness made me a generalist. I love big questions and wandering across fields: psychology (of course), linguistics, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, physics (I was on my high-school physics Olympiad team), biology, and more. This curiosity is also why I take an intentionally interdisciplinary approach in my research.

Outside of work I am very outdoorsy. I like walking through neighborhoods, learning new cultures—first across regions of China, now across the United States—and spending time with friends.
