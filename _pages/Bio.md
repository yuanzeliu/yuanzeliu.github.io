I was born in mid-fall after a [major flood in southern China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_China_floods). As a result, my parents gave me a name that is a small pun. Publicly, most people read it in a Confucian key—beneficence that reaches far. Privately, it means staying away from marshes and floods—my parents simply wanted me to be safe. 

For the first 14 years of my life, I never left my small hometown in the middle of nowhere. Both of my parents are locals, and so were our earliest traceable ancestors—going back a thousand years (my friend and advisor Josh visited our family temple and can vouch for that!). 

By all expectations, I might have stayed, grown old, and died in my hometown (and you won't be seeing this website if that happened). My mother’s dream for me was to graduate from high school, and she promised a big party if I did. But I’ve always had an annoyingly curious and adventurous streak, which has consistently nudged me off the expected path (sorry, Mom!). 

At 14 I left home for school, lived four years in Changsha, seven in Beijing, and I have been in Chicago for the last two years. I am always excited for the next stop!

That same adventurousness made me a generalist. I love big questions that span multiple fields, like psychology (of course), linguistics, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and biology.

When not doing research, I’ll likely be outside. I love walking around neighborhoods, learning about new cultures, and spending time with friends.
