I was born in mid-fall after a [major flood in southern China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_China_floods). My parents gave me a name that is a small pun. Publicly, most people read it in a Confucian key—beneficence that reaches far. Privately, it’s the “individualistic” opposite, meaning staying away from marshes and floods—my parents simply wanted me to be safe. Perhaps thanks to the magic of this name, I survived a severe car accident as a kid; otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this page.

For the first 14 years of my life, I never once left our hometown. Both of my parents are locals, and so were our earliest traceable ancestors—going back a thousand years (my friend and advisor Josh visited our family temple and can vouch for that!). 

By all expectations I might have stayed, grown old, and died my hometown. I still remember my mom telling me in kindergarten that her biggest hope was for me to finish high school so she could throw a big party. But I’ve always had an annoyingly curious and adventurous streak, which has consistently nudged me off the expected path (sorry, Mom!). 

At 14 I left home for school, lived four years in Changsha, seven in Beijing, and I have been in Chicago for more than two years—always looking toward the next stop.

That same adventurousness made me a generalist. I love big questions and wandering across fields: psychology (of course), linguistics, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, physics (I stayed one year on my high-school physics Olympiad team), biology, and more. This curiosity is also why I take an interdisciplinary approach in my research.

Outside of work I am very outdoorsy. I like walking through neighborhoods, learning new cultures—first across regions of China, now across the United States—and spending time with friends.
